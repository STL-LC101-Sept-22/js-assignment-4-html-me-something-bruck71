               <p>
                  This is a summary of my trip from Florida to the British Virgin Islands on a 44 foot power catamaran in the summer of 2022. <br>
                  <br><b>&#x2022 Past Experience:</b><br>
                  Over the past couple of years I have been working as a transport captain for people who need their new to them boats relocated.  I mainly operate on inland waterways taking boats from St Louis through the river systems. I have completed transports as far north as Mackinaw City, Michigan and as far south to Chattanooga, TN.<br>
                  <br><b>&#x2022 The BVI Transport:</b><br>
                  Although, I had a decent amount of experience doing transpors, I did not have any on open water let alone the ocean.
                  <br>Luckily the Captain that taught my captain's class regularly moves boats for Marine Max Vacations from Florida to different Islands in the Virgin Islands.  I was able to get on his short list of captains that could be first mate on these trips and answered the call when it came.
                     Marine Max Vacations uses Aquila Power Catamarans in a charter/rental fleet based out of Tortola, BVI.  Our job is to deliver a brand new 2022 Auila 44 Power Cat to their main base.<br>

                     The other captain and I took five hour shifts on and five hour shifts off while we were underway.  We only stopped for fuel and anchored when our timing on entering new ports allowed.<br>
                     <br>We ended up stopping 5 times for overnight stays even if it was just for a few hours and 5 times to fuel up.<br>

               <h4>Heading down Florida's Gulf Coast:</h4>
               <p>
                  Day one of the trip was spent in clearwater provisioning and checking all systems on the boat.  I got my experience behind the helm of this power cat on the trip to fuel up before we took off the next morning.  Day 2 was a full day underway to Naples where we topped off our fuel tanks, had dinner at the marina restraunt, and spent the night.  
                  Day three was the first part of our multiple day voyage across the gulf streem to the Bahamas.  We fueled up in the Florida Keys in the early afternoon and pulled an overnighter making the big cross. 
                  We arrived in the bahamas well after dark the next day and dropped anchor to spend the night until the fuel dock opened in the morning at Staniel Cay.<br>

               <p>
                  After fueling in the Bahamas it was off to Turks and Caicos for fuel and customs checks.

               <p>
                  Once we made it through the customs process of Turks and Caicos we were allowed to fuel and head out to Puero Rico.  This will be the longest stretch of the trip without stopping.

               <h4>Puerto Rico:</h4>
               <p>
                  After almost three days at sea we finally made it to a port and dry land in Puerto Real on the West Coast of Puerto Rico.  We spent the remainder of the afternoon and night there and then headed out for Esperanza on the Island of Vieques just off the East Coast of Puerto Rico.

                  The final day underway took us through the Virgin Islands to the home port on Tortola BVI.
